MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is the most famous benchmark dataset in computer vision and machine learning, consisting of handwritten digit images.

Key Characteristics:
Content: 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9)
60,000 training examples
10,000 test examples

Image Format:
28Ã—28 pixel resolution (784 dimensions)
Grayscale (single channel) with pixel values 0-255
Classes: 10 (digits 0 through 9)
Difficulty: Considered a "solved" problem with modern techniques achieving >99% accuracy



A convolutional neural network (CNN) implementation for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a CNN model that achieves ~99% accuracy on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).


## Features
- Simple and clean implementation using TensorFlow/Keras
- Data loading and preprocessing pipeline
- CNN model with:
  - Two convolutional layers
  - Max pooling layers
  - Fully connected layers
